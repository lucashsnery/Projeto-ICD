"Gente, I have to say that this victory of Ainda Estou Aqui was cathartic for me and my mother  My grandfather was arrested and tortured in 1971 for supporting better working conditions, he was left with permanent sequelae in his spine because of what he went through... He was always very vocal about the military dictatorship, and to see how far Rubens and Eunice Paiva's story has come is heartwarming.

"My grandmother was also imprisoned and tortured. She was married to a journalist who helped the party, and she acted on it too. She's still alive. When I watched the movie, I thought she wouldn't see it because of some trigger or something.  But she saw it and said it was perfect. That things like the car stopped in front of the house to keep watch happened to her too.  The biggest victory of the movie was to show this reality, while we have deniers who say it didn't even happen.",positivo,7,1,geekrevoltado,2025-03-03 00:27:45
"Sending a big hug to your grandmother and to all of you ü´Ç It's so comforting to see the reality of what the dictatorship was like going so far, even winning Oscars.  We need to keep the memory alive so that the dictatorship is never repeated, WITHOUT ANISTY and justice for all the victims of the military dictatorship!  How I wish my grandfather had been here to see this moment, to have seen the movie because he was also from Rio... I find it extremely painful when someone denies that the dictatorship existed. I've already seen my grandfather's reaction when he heard something like that from someone in my uncle's family (who is married to my aunt, his daughter).  I'm having so many memories of him now, just as I did when I saw the movie... I can't even think straight, I'm so emotional",positivo,2,2,palomathereptilian,2025-03-03 01:35:56
"What I found funny is that your name is ""palomathereptilian"", and you said that the Oscar win was cathartic for you and your mother... My grandmother has a daughter called Paloma ü§£ but if it was your grandfather who was arrested, it's certainly not the same person.  Jokes aside, I think it's great how my grandmother doesn't get scared or nervous when talking about it. She even treats it with a certain good humor. But of course, it's surreal to think that we went through that. Today she's a hippie who smokes several joints a day and lives practically in the forest.  Hugs to your family too!",positivo,2,3,geekrevoltado,2025-03-03 10:52:36
"Wow, what a coincidence üëÄ I hope your aunt is okay!  And yes, in my case it was my maternal grandfather... He was from Rio, although he moved here to S√£o Paulo in 1996 (my mother and aunt moved here) and unfortunately died in 2020, he had already been ill with COPD for about 16 years  I'm very happy that your grandmother is able to talk about it, it's very important to keep that memory alive... It's not just anyone who can talk so openly about something so traumatic, I hope she's well and having a wonderful life in the forest ü§ç May she have all the high quality bases in the world ü•∞  My grandfather spoke some things, but he couldn't talk much about what he went through üòî He had a lot of that survivors guilt thing, 3 of his coworkers unfortunately disappeared and that impacted him a lot... So we learned some details of what happened only after he died, which made me even sadder about what he went through üíî  I hope he's okay, wherever he is now...

I know that voting isn't simply a matter of you choosing the best movie and that's it, the voters list the best to the worst, so aberrations can happen, such as an actress who isn't chosen first, but has appeared in second and third place, by average, winning.
