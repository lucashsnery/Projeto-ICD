The truth is that the Oscars shouldn't be taken seriously at all. They're more about the glamour and marketing more than celebrating the best of what Cinema has to offer.

"I also cannot ignore the fact that Demi Moore spends large chunks of time completely unconscious in a dark closet and offscreen. Meanwhile, the camera stays with Mikey Madison and Fernanda Torres 95% of the time.

Not saying that makes a performance less impressive. But it definitely puts one at a disadvantage in terms of voter recognition.",positivo,3,2
"Totally agree. Demi was in less than half of the film, and it put her at a total disadvantage, even if she was narratively the main character and had more screen-time than anyone else.

The issue of co-leads in general is complicated though, putting her in supporting would create different problems. Kieran Culkin was great, but he swept because he was actually a co-lead and was in like 60% of the film, which gave him an unfair advantage.",positivo,3,3

While The Substance lacked as much dialogue for this reason, I thought Demi was still really able to shine throughout her performance and offer so much depth through her body language, single shots, and limited dialogue. I thought she deserved it just as much as Mikey, but it definitely does put her at a disadvantage in terms of voter recognition.",negativo,2,3

Literally binged 3 of the best pic noms over the weekend in preparation for tonight just to have the fucking telecast shut off on me right before best picture. Not that I‚Äôm not glad I watched them and I can‚Äôt just go back and watch the speeches but I‚Äôm so irritated.,negativo,9,0
"My one issue with Anora is that, as much as it claims to be a movie about sw and advocate for sex workers, it missed the mark for me. I really wished we got some more depth of Mikey's character besides the one scene shown with her interacting with her family and the one scene at the end. I do really love that movies advocating for sw are getting recognition and I do think this is a really good start, I do wish this movie was just able to encapsulate it more, because most of the comments I see about the movie nag on how naive Mikey's character was, which, from first glance, I can understand. But there is sooo much more to that and I wish it was jus conveyed more.",positivo,9,0
"Strong agreement here. Aside from a handful of scenes this film greatly undwhelmed and ultimately had me feeling like I saw something different than everyone else. Mikey did a fine job, she deserves recognition for her humane and throbbing perforance, but there were career defining roles out there this year and I'm sorry but wtf really Anora sweeps with its pretty blah second and third acts?

How this film snubbed Demi is absurd and makes the Substance messaging all the more relevant.",negativo,6,1
"Unfortunately, Demi Moore‚Äôs character in *The Substance* was also poorly developed. We literally learn nothing about her except for her pursuit of recognition/validation/praise. No other hobbies, views, friends, family, nothing.

This may have been purposely done by Fargeat to make a point, but it still makes it harder to really have a layered performance there, in my opinion.",negativo,1,2
"Travis Bickle didn't have any of that, either.


Yeah really difficult to give a layered performance without hobbies. They should have like shown Demi playing pickleball or something.",positivo,1,3
"I haven‚Äôt seen *Taxi Driver* for years, but I may have the same issue there. I do seem to remember we get a sense of his personality a bit more, though?

I don‚Äôt need to see a hobby, per se. But at least some personality. Elisabeth doesn‚Äôt speak much, so even some more lines would have helped. For example, the sarcasm that drips from your short reply already gives me a sense of your personality.",negativo,1,4
"Big personalities aren't the only ones that exist. Ryan Gosling didn't have many lines at all in Drive. He internalized and it came across subtly. Same with Benicio Del Toro in Sicario. Acting isn't just all about lines.


I haven't seen substance, so I don't even know if Demi Moore is capable of a nuanced performance. I struggle to think of anything she was good in.


And if you have issues with De Niro in Taxi Driver it's probably your problem. He was fucking brilliant in that. Dude was a bomb waiting to explode.",positivo,1,5
"No that‚Äôs fair. But you keep latching onto one thing and thinking I‚Äôm saying that it‚Äôs ‚Äúall about‚Äù that thing. I‚Äôm saying the absence of *all* of those things is what makes *The Substance* exceptionally bizarre.

Edit: I haven‚Äôt seen *Drive* and didn‚Äôt care for *Sicario*, but I do agree with you that people have given good performances without speaking much. And I never meant to imply that Demi Moore didn‚Äôt do a great job.",positivo,2,6
"Absence of what? Views, friends, family, personality, and lines? And it's a horror movie so it isn't supposed to be bizarre?


Just curious what is your favorite movie or some of them?",positivo,1,7
"Hated both Sicario and Drive, probably because of this 'rear window' boring acting were somehow we are supposed to project 'deeper meaning' onto truly boring people.

DeNiro on the other hand: now that was interesting and completely agree with 'a bomb waiting to explode'",negativo,1,6
"The movie is his backstory into going crazy, so not the best example.

But I agree a character doesn't need to have a million pages of backstory, they need to be interesting and entertaining. One of the reason a lot of movies fail is because they just hint at 3 cliches and within the first 40 seconds we are supposed to care. 'ultra trained killer' 'but really doen't like murdering all those people' 'best they have ever trained' 'feels really really really bad at being so good at it' 'has no choice, just has to mass murder da fuq out of everything to save $50 for this little innocent girl'


Demi playing Pickleball: dude, I think you just wrote an oscar winning movie! As long as it is in a bad neighbourhood, her boss sucks and she is in some horrible job that required a LOT of acting.",negativo,1,4
Oh man you people and your message. It's about aesthetics. Fuck the message I want spectacle.,negativo,1,2
"Interestingly, I‚Äôve seen a lot of sex workers be completely fine with the lack of back story. To quote one I saw:

‚ÄúThe only two narratives people are seemingly capable of digesting re: sex work are ‚Äúmillionaire girlboss dominatrix‚Äù and ‚Äútrafficking victim‚Äù and I think the issue a lot of people have with Anora is the lack of a tragic backstory for her. but a lot of us don‚Äôt have one‚Äú

We don‚Äôt need to know why she does sex work. Just that it‚Äôs her job.",neutro,3,1
"I really liked Anora but more just as a movie than as a story about sex work. Tangerine and The Florida Project are amazing and realistic works from the same director that handle the topic so he is capable of it, just looking at things from a different angle this time, which is ok",positivo,1,1
"The character has a lot of depth, it was just lost on you. If you want people advocating for sex work go work charity or buy a lapdance. Movies are meant for entertainment.",positivo,0,1

I don't think Mikey Madison's win was undeserving (she was really great - at least I'm not surprised by the outcome), but my pick would have been Demi Moore in The Substance. That scene trying to fix her makeup obsessively was insane. And also Zoe Saldana should have been nominated for the best actress in the leading role instead of Karla Gascon. The significance of her character was more than just a storyteller in that movie, it felt a bit unfair to compete in that category with other supporting actresses. Instead, Margaret Qualley would be a nice nominee for the best supporting actress for her role as Sue, a good ant√≠tese to Elizabeth's character.",positivo,15,0

He was the youngest winner ever and by decades end his career was pretty much in the dumps and even recently he's been doing some almost SyFy channel level bullshit.  Saying that he's gained some perspective from that and how much winning again and being quality films would be a fine point, but Jesus the way he structured all that was silly as hell.",negativo,11,1
"The speech was fine, just way too long. I don't get why people are so offended by it.",negativo,3,2
"People are offended because it was so long it cut the last couple awards off. Like Hulu stopped playing the ceremony because it was supposed to be over. The people watching it that way missed BP and Best Actress.

Everyone knew they were running behind, and he did that purposely.",positivo,10,3
There‚Äôs no way he did that ‚Äúon purpose‚Äù to cut off the last award. The Oscars runs late every year and the longest speeches are the last ones because those are the biggest awards,positivo,2,4
"I mean he went on too long on purpose. He knew they were behind and basically shushed the play off music.

It might not have been his exact intent to cut people off, but it was his intent to speak far too long knowing how many minutes were left in the program for those other two winners. So‚Ä¶ basically the same thing. It‚Äôs a toss up whether various viewing formats will keep streaming a live program or not. He screwed people over because he wouldn‚Äôt hush.",positivo,5,5
">People are offended because it was so long

Nah, people are annoyed because it was too long. But there are also people here, that were legitimately offended by ""arrogant speech of insufferable Brody"". I just don't find anything he said arrogant.",negativo,1,4
I think the length is what made it arrogant and insufferable! He didn‚Äôt say anything he couldn‚Äôt have said in less like AND started it by promising to be brief!!,positivo,10,5
"Also him telling the people who are controlling the music which politely signifies to stop talking, to shut off the music so he could keep on blah blahing, was extremely arrogant. He wasn't saying anything meaningful.",negativo,5,6
"Seriously. The music is the polite way of telling you your time is over. Telling the people whose job it is to keep it moving to stop doing their job so he can‚Ä¶ say nothing? Ugh.

I was watching on on regular tv, but a friend called me to listen because her stream just shut off before the last two awards.",positivo,7,7
It would have been epic if the music instructor just doubled down and played louder.,positivo,3,8
The way he spoke to the music conductor was extremely arrogant. He could have said what he said in half the time and it would have been fine.,negativo,5,5
"what I took from his speech is that he does not want to glamorize winning an award. looking back from his first oscar win, it did not really made a huge boost from his career ( he even mentioned in an interview that he did not have a job for a year after winning an oscar). so he is telling that he is grateful for this recognition, but in the end it is still about hard work.


he kind really go all over the place for his speech but personally I did not find it arrogant.",positivo,7,1
"He should have respected the time limit. Everyone else mostly did, all the ""little""¬†non famous people did.",positivo,13,2
"yes, personally a 45 second speech is a bit short and some winners were actually cut off. at the same time, we just do not know how it actually feels standing on that stage.",positivo,3,3
"Someone who does sound stuff or practical effects or what have you is going to be a lot more nervous speaking in front of a huge audience. I think they should be allowed more time to account for that.¬† Someone like Adrien Brody who is obviously used to talking in front of a large group of strangers, should be able to say what he needed to say without going on for 6x the amount of alloted time.",positivo,7,4

The Academy likes conventional acting. They're not so thrilled about a performance (or a movie) where the musical performances were the best part of it.,positivo,2,2
I don't think that the movie was that compelling. I think it was a movie that no one asked for and that Timothee did because he thought it earn him an Oscar. That's it. I'm pretty sure before he got handed the script for the movie from his agent that he didn't even know who Bob Dylan was.,positivo,1,2
I loved A Complete Unknown. But it was the feeling of being a fly on the wall at some important performances in musical history that made it special for me. Timothee Chalamet and Monica Barbaro both did amazing jobs of recreating classic performers and performances.,positivo,1,3

Not many movies this year that really made me enjoyed. I kinda liked 'The Fall guy' and Dream scenario. Dune 2 was ok, Chalamet is very good at being what he needs to be for the movie.


Really enjoyed 'A real pain' because it was such a low key movie with just two strong performances. But, like to many movies' you have to be ready for this. If you are expecting 'stuff to happen' this is a super boring film.",positivo,1,1
"Fair point. I was kind of just adding to the argumentative tone so I was being a bit hypocritical. My two favourite movies of the year were The Brutalist and Anora, so I was unusually happy with the Oscars.

The Substance and The Brutalist were both far significantly better than it and had better performances by a mile.",positivo,29,0

You said it better!,positivo,0,4
"I really liked the way the movie subverts your expectations of the Russian henchmen, who in American films are usually portrayed as brutes for someone like John Wick to kill mercilessly. I thought the dynamic between Ani and Vanya was also done really well. It‚Äôs not love, obviously. It‚Äôs a working relationship that blurs a lot of lines. There were a lot of subtleties in their interactions that I really enjoyed. The script manages to be very funny and engaging while also leaving the viewer feeling very, very sad at the end. The sad is just under the surface the whole time. Underneath the partying and then searching for Vanya. Sean Baker is a genius, basically. In my opinion. It‚Äôs all subjective",positivo,0,3
"What is your position on Anora character? I think half of my disappointment with that movie comes from the fact, they made her utterly, unbelievably naive, dumb even. I get why Vanya is infantile - everything was handed to him and so he never grew. He didn't have to.

But the opposite is true for Anora, she is ""erotic dancer"". The line of work that teches you life in the fastest manner. The kind of job where you can't trust any man, especially those tied to russian money. Yet up until almost very end she still believes there is some ""love"" in all that transactional relation she had with her ""husband"". She was naive, to the point even Vanya himself told her before entering airplane, that she's dumb if she think this is not over.

I just don't find her character arc in this whole wicked scenario remotely believable. Regardless how much vision of a better life can pink filter our eyes, you got to drop the mask eventually. When goons came by, it should be last wake up call but it wasn't.",negativo,5,4
"People do crazy things for money and the idea of a better life, and I wouldn‚Äôt agree that she believed he loved her. I wouldn‚Äôt take everything Ani says out loud at face value",positivo,0,5
"I did also liked the Russian henchmen bit, it was refreshing for sure. I thought it started strong but it became pretty predictable for me, there wasn't a lot of intrigue for me after a while, you kinda know where the movie is gunna go. I personally don't see the script as smart, It didn't the do anything for me to consider it as such. Appreciate the reply.",positivo,3,4
I see! I do agree with a lot of this. Doesn‚Äôt make it best picture to me but definitely something I enjoyed while watching :),positivo,1,4
"Absolutely. Baker did a fabulous job with ‚ÄúThe Florida Project‚Äù as well, so it‚Äôs great to see him get his full recognition now with ‚ÄúAnora‚Äù. Not easy at all to blend humor into a brutal story like this and he did it incredibly well. He‚Äôs a great director of actors as well‚Ä¶so many terrific performances in all his films.

"In defense of Camille‚Ä¶(Emilia P√©rez)

I know Americans do not know her, and this is a TERRIBLE way for her to enter the mainstream, but Camille is an incredible artist with an amazing body of work.

She is very well-renowned in France and has been called the Bj√∂rk of the country because of her experimental approach to music and composition.

I don‚Äôt know what happened and why the music in Emilia P√©rez is so shit, but I promise she is an incredibly cool and weird artist, and I implore you all to listen to her album Le fil. It‚Äôs a really cool avant-pop record that has no instruments, solely arranged with Camille‚Äôs voice, and plays with the natural musicality of the French language to provide flow and rhythm.

I am a huge fan and hate that Emilia P√©rez is what she is becoming known for üò≠",positivo,9,0

Do you think the younger academy members give a shit about horror films any more than the other voters?,negativo,3,2
Yes. I absolutely do. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs popular. But the numbers would still be far higher compared to the votes from older members. I have worked in film for 22 years now. You‚Äôd be amazed how absolutely anti-horror/sci-fi older producers/actors are. Filmmakers tend to be more open minded oddly enough. But older actors and producers absolutely consider the two genres as a bottom of the barrel type of thing.,positivo,6,3
"Substance as nearly twice as long as it needed to be and made very little sense. I honestly don‚Äôt understand the interpretation that it‚Äôs a critique of female beauty and youth ‚Ä¶ it felt more like a boring confusion to me, but apparently it resonated with many? Moore did great work within a terribly flawed and indulgent (to the writer-director) film.",positivo,-3,1

"Sorry, it‚Äôs ham-fisted work. Putting pieces on the stage that allow for an interpretation is not the creation of ‚Äúmetaphor‚Äù and ‚Äúsubtext.‚Äù

The Substance is an ‚Äúthought piece‚Äù for the lazy. Again, it takes from Cronenbhrg and Kubrick (not to mention DePalma) with both hands and does nearly nothing original of its own.

I hope Moore gets a revival because her work in the film was brave and gutsy and she deserves it but the writer-director flat out failed her here.",negativo,0,3

Brutalist we didn't get to yet, but Anora definitely felt like films we've watched that weren't even nominated for BP were more memorable than it was, I have no idea how it ended up with the win. At that point give it to flow, it was at least very creative cinema.

Secondly, a lot of Americans don't seem to understand that in a lot of countries, black face isn't a big deal. Jim Crow laws and the negative history of black face is only really present in the USA. Heck, I'm from the Netherlands, and less than a decade ago, people were doing what is basically black face because it was part of a traditional holiday, and most people were ok with it because it wasn't meant to offend anyone. Only in more recent years, when a lot more Dutch people (mostly those from African decent) started to be more vocal on the issue they have with it, and therefore, people stopped doing it.

Anora was a solid film and tbf none of the films this season were anything revolutionary and will be forgotten by the time the next award season rolls out and calling someone who gives their opinion a rando really shows how u are and somewhere validates my statement of ppl just going abt demeaning others.

All with the same thematic message. Just because the tone changes doesn‚Äôt mean it says anything deeper. In my opinion all these tonal switches are fun and that‚Äôs it. Compare the layered complex turns of a film like parasite that really forces the audience to confront ideas of right or wrong and what drove people to do the things they do in the film.

Trump would want the attention as he‚Äôs proved he‚Äôs an attention whore for good or bad attention. Not mentioning him was the best move in my opinion. Jane Fonda took a stance at the SAG awards. She did not mention him by name but said ‚Äú we have to fight what‚Äôs coming‚Äù,negativo,6,1

We don't care what actors political opinions are. The Oscars are to celebrate art. Keep politics out of it,positivo,2,1
That is impossible. The movie industry is political and getting a world stage should cause a wish and an urge to let everyone know that what is going on is not okay.,positivo,1,2

I've hated him since he snatched his little award from Ke Huy Quan, not even looking at him, as if he was a fucking coatrack. Obviously envious and bitter. The snide entitlement on him is INSANE. Like, he's a fine actor but he's never had a performance blow me away and he does not deserve the hype.

Like, calm down Iron Man. Clearly Oppenheimer was a consolation prize to SOME extent. Fuck that guy.",positivo,2,0

"I usually give people a lot of grace for the way they react to winning (or losing) because the cameras are zoomed in and people are just waiting to pick apart every single microexpression and create controversy out of nothing, but you're absolutely right this was pretty egregious, he didn't even make eye contact with him!",positivo,1,1
"Thank you!! No, I totally get giving people grace. And maybe I was a bit harsh. But the lack of even an attempt at eye contact by someone who has no trouble with eye contact with anyone else, agree, was egregious.

There is something in my intuition that prickles me so hard about RDJ that I've never felt about anyone else. I think it's about entitlement. Yes, he had a rough past. But look at at the dozens of other actors with rough pasts - look at minority women especially, like DaVine Joy Randloph - and you see such grace and humility about their pasts, not such...*Stark* entitlement about them ;)

To me it's a clear enough case of RDJ thinking he's so far above this newcomer - who is such a sweet humble guy - that he doesn't even deign to look at him. And there's nothing more shitty to me.

But most of the people who signed the petition or/and worked with him hasn't really said much about him afterwards as far as I know. And even some wanted their names removed or regretted working with him such as Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and Natalie Portman. However, Brody literally flat out said he doesn't give a shit about the sexual allegations and it pisses me off how someone can think that way.",negativo,2,4

"Fucking bullshit! It doesn't even matter what her age was, drugging and raping someone isn't cool as well as escaping from prison time. And like you said, he's had other accusers and there's rumors he was abusive to Sharon Tate. I really wish the Manson family went after him instead of Sharon!",negativo,2,6
"Drugging for sex was accepted back then. And if the woman lied about her daughter‚Äôs age, then that‚Äôs also really fucked up. So the situation wasn‚Äôt nearly as black and white as everybody outside of LA wants to believe. Scarlett Johansson also supports Woody Allen and believes what he says, but she almost never gets any backlash for that. But Brody gets dragged on social media for a similar stance for a friend. I am glad the Academy didn‚Äôt pay attention to that noise, because Brody deserved the Oscar. And he should have won the SAG Award.",positivo,2,7
"Well, then screw ScarJo. Well...both literally and metaphorically. Although I'm in the camp that thinks the comparisons are a bit harsh between Woody and Polanski. However, I'm not a Woody defender by a long shot!

Gwyneth Paltrow pursued other ventures of her own volition, so I can‚Äôt exactly say her career tanked.

Marisa Tomei seems like a shoe-horn since she won Supporting, but even still her career was pretty prolific.

Mikey Madison winning best actress is ridiculous and lame. Just my opinion. Taking your clothes off flashing your breasts and shaking your ass in a movie is apparently Oscar worthy. The film is gratuitous and lame. Demi Moore or Fernanda Torres deserves it. Two talented older actresses of course lost to a flash in the pan young white wonan.Society will always value a young white woman in a cliche film. The substance challenges the beauty standards of society. In the end the old male Oscar voters favored a young white woman taking her clothes off.,positivo,-2,0

Yes, Demi was way better but you forget that after 30 first minutes of Anora, Madison actually stops ""flashing"" and start acting. And it was decent enough of an effort for nomination, I just don't see it award worthy.

But still, you're being reductive.",positivo,4,1
Even the first 30 minutes represented incre√≠ble acting from Madison. She embodied that role 100% to the point where I was asking my friends if she's really been a sex worker/stripper before.,positivo,5,2
"> The substance challenges the beauty standards of society.

It‚Äôs amazing to me that people can think this. The movie was an embarrassment on almost all fronts. Moore did some good things but the rest  was a low effort rip off is Croneberg and Kubrick that offered no intelligent commentary whatsoever. Gratuitous and lame is right.

Madison‚Äôs performance was one of the best in a long time. Why you fee the need to reduce women to their bodies is unclear. Her character was deep. Madison is half Japanese if that matters (it shouldn‚Äôt).

Sadly I haven‚Äôt seen Torres yet.",positivo,2,1
"What does Mikey being half Japanese have to do with anything? She was excellent in the film but it should not have won as many awards as it did. Sean Baker does not have the skillset to make movies on a large scale. He will never work in the studio system. Yes he can frame that it‚Äôs by choice, but you cannot tell me he could handle a budget like Denis or Jon Chu can. He just can‚Äôt. Working on movies of that scale (~$250M+) is a freight train with so. many. moving. pieces. Making a $6M indie that is essentially a polished version of a student film is not near as commendable but good luck trying to win that argument.",positivo,4,2
"> What does Mikey being half Japanese have to do with anything?

The OP repeatedly went on about ‚Äúwhite women‚Äù (as if it mattered).

Who cares if Baker can handle a big movie? Dune was enormous and complicated and ended up dull and pointless. If you value vapid eye candy, good for you. You probably loved Dune. It wasn‚Äôt art, which is what I hope to see when I hand over my time. Anora explored a small, marginalized community with wit and heart and that‚Äôs worth far more in my book.

Sicario was a treat and Arrival was decent but the Dune movies and Blade Runner 2049 were really just rococo snorefests.",positivo,3,3

"Why is this movie and everyone tied to it awful? I keep seeing people hating on it, but must be living under a rock lolüòÖüòÖ",negativo,3,1
"To start, I would say you should watch it and decide for yourself what you think. Next, keep in mind that the movie is supposed to portray Mexican culture, Mexican characters, cartels, and lastly, the main character transitions from male to female.

Now, in premise, nothing wrong about any of this. The problem is the execution. To start, none of the main characters are Mexican, the Spanish dialogue is awful and is cringe if you are a native spanish speaker, especially someone who is Mexican. I am Mexican myself and I can comfortably speak to this movie having nothing Mexican about it.

Then, you have the main character, Emilia Perez, who is a trans woman that basically tries to atone for her sins from when she was a cartel leader and the movie makes it seem like she was reborn once she transitioned. I‚Äôm not a trans person but my understanding is that this is a big misrepresentation of what it means to be trans. There is even a very cringey song about what it means to transition that you would think some random novice wrote it.

Lastly, the main actress turned out to be an awful person, tho Mexicans already knew this but you can go and search for her tweets on what her opinions are surrounding Muslims in Spain. The director is also an idiot who openly said Mexico has no talented actors to be in his movie and that he didn‚Äôt need to research anything about Mexican culture, trans issues, etc because he already knew everything he needed to know. Overall, it‚Äôs a pretty awful movie but like I said, you should watch and decide for yourself. In Mexico, everybody hated it and this movie is supposed to be ‚ÄúMexican‚Äù",negativo,1,2

"I truly believe that Wicked‚Äôs reception at award shows would have been drastically different if it weren‚Äôt for Ariana Grande‚Äôs highly publicized affair with her married co-star. The controversy has undeniably tarnished the film‚Äôs reputation, overshadowing its artistic merits and the work of the entire cast and crew.

Scandals like these tend to stick, especially in an industry where public perception plays a significant role in a movie‚Äôs success. Instead of discussions centered on the performances, direction, or musical numbers, much of the conversation has been dominated by tabloid drama. This kind of negative press can create a ripple effect‚Äîaudiences lose interest, critics become harsher, and voters at award shows may hesitate to fully support the project.

It‚Äôs frustrating because Wicked had all the ingredients for a major awards contender: a beloved source material, a strong fan base, and a talented team. But when controversy takes center stage, even the most promising films struggle to regain their footing.",positivo,-1,0
"Sorry but I think that‚Äôs a big big reach.

A bunch of films and people with MUCH bigger controversies won awards. Whatever scandal Wicked had, I don‚Äôt think it even broke the news as much as the silly ‚Äúholding space‚Äù interview.

It‚Äôs just not the kind of film that the Academy goes for outside of the technical categories.",negativo,8,1
"While it probably contributed to a degree, the film got a lot of praise and noms. The lack of wins stems from the fact that the second half of the film comes out this year so many are likely waiting to give it awards next year, providing it's deserving.",positivo,5,1
"While I think that the publicity of the affair certainly isn‚Äôt helping, the Academy doesn‚Äôt always recognize the first in a series of films for the big awards. I think this is evidenced by the lack of a Jon M. Chu Best Director nom. I think what will be more telling is how the second part does at next year‚Äôs Ceremony.

They took home awards in technical categories because nothing else came close in terms of the sheer scale and creativity of the production design and costuming.",positivo,5,1
I disagree‚Äîit‚Äôs a movie musical which the academy typically doesn‚Äôt go gaga over especially nowadays and also it‚Äôs part 1. My money is on Erivo to win next year,positivo,4,1
"I understand that people have different perspectives on this, and that‚Äôs totally fair. This is just my personal take on how public perception can sometimes impact a film‚Äôs success, especially during awards season. Of course, the movie‚Äôs quality speaks for itself, but Hollywood has shown time and time again that off-screen drama can influence how projects are received. It‚Äôs just an observation, not a definitive statement!",positivo,2,2
"I don‚Äôt think it has much impact as you are hoping it would have, the others were just strong contenders who deserved to win.

Affairs in showbiz is a minor offense, it gets brushed off easily by the people in a week or two.",positivo,3,1
"I think that the IRL drama did impact the reception of the film, but not from an awards standpoint. Wicked was never going to win best picture but it did well in the categories where it had the best chance to do well. The quality of the costumes is undeniable. I think if there had been original songs to submit for this year they would have smoked Emilia P√©rez. If it were up to me I would have given Erivo an award just for Defying Gravity. Wicked also has a second chance to take home major prizes next year. Essentially all the PR they've done this year will snowball so that when part two is released it will leave a very strong impression. I would not be surprised if Cynthia takes home a little gold man next year, but a lot of it depends on what performances she's competing against.",positivo,2,1
"Irrespective of whether or not that's true (I doubt it), it led to indie movies dominating the night rather than a mega blockbuster. And that is undeniably a good thing",positivo,1,1
"I saw Wicked‚Ä¶ it was honestly so boring and cringey‚Ä¶. Literally felt like I was watching the wizard if oz themed high school musical‚Ä¶

The ""And?"" is it very goofy to be mad about Anora promoting sex work when it shows it as largely degrading while you're responding as if it trying to make it aspirational.

Personally, I think that while the film finds a lot of humor in it's presentation, it's pretty matter of fact regarding the bleakness of her situation within her profession and the complications of all of your interactions being transactional and through sex.  That last scene is pretty devastating.  There's one character of the film who interacts with her on a level, person to person basis.  He does something kind for her and her immediate response is to have sex with him, responding with that transaction even though that's not why he did it or terms he was setting.  That's the only way she can interact with people, and she seems to realize it.   Honestly though I doubt you've seen it at all so why bother.",negativo,6,6
"By highlight I don‚Äôt mean highlight literally - I don‚Äôt think Sean is trying to make sex work look good - it‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm using highlight as in him choosing to showcase this topic. Highlight was a poor word choice. But he portrays it as bad because it is bad. And it‚Äôs a means to an end, or at least she thinks it is. But she is treated like shit because her profession is shit. So this is a problem of her own making. So why are we ‚Äúhighlighting‚Äù or shining a light on this issue that is inherently low class and the reason she is in her predicament? The Russian family is proof of that. The movie was a big so what to me. Different strokes for different folks.

It's not like Mikey didn't work her ass off in Anora. She didn't get that Oscar without merit. The fact that people dismiss her achievement by saying that she only got it because she's young and hot is exactly what's fueling the misogyny that they are supposedly training to stand up against.

1. Demi should have won (& I'm not even a fan of hers).
2. Despite all the prior awards, Kieran didn't deserve the win. He wasn't great, nor was his movie. Strong, Peace & Norton are much better actors.
3. Brody talked way too damn long. What is wrong with him? Ego gotten too big?
4. Chalamet was wrong to think he would win as his girlfriend has lowered his respectability.
5. Why wasn't Conclave nominated for best cinematography?
6. Hallie Berry was the best dressed female.
7. It was nice to see awards get spread out to many films.
8. Karla Sophia had a lot of courage to show up, and I give her credit for that. How many of us have stepped out of the wokeness box at times and said things we shouldn't have? I'm not condoning things she said, but maybe she needs some forgiveness. Just a thought.",positivo,-1,0
"Norton did give a great, very believable performance as Pete Seeger and I was rooting for him to win. I agree that Conclave should have been nominated for its cinematography too.",positivo,2,1
"Kieran's performance was excellent, besides, this is all super subjective. I really enjoyed A real Pain because it was so different.

Brody is nuts, suffers from Villeneuve-Nolan disease. Chalamet announced at the SAG awards he wants to be 'greatness' or something so everybody voted for someone else haha.

"By the word ""Glorify"" do you read ""Mention"". The word ""glorify"" includes a group of people. I was referring to the reactions and the ""glorification"" of achieving things as a person of color.

"Some stats for this year's major award categories.

Best movie - All white cast
Best director - white man in a movie with an all white cast
Best Actor - white man in a movie with white cast in lead roles
Best Actress - white woman in a movie with an all white cast
Best supporting actor - white man in a movie with a mostly white cast
Best supporting actress - WOC
Best cinematography - white man in a movie with a mostly white cast

Now compare that to the winners the year #OscarsSoWhite was created due to the blatant lack of diversity

Best movie - mostly white cast
Best director - a Mexican man won
Best actor - white man
Best actress - white woman
Best supporting actor - white man
Best supporting actress - white woman
Best cinematography - a Mexican man won

2025 - out of 7 categories 1 winner was a POC
2015 - out of 7 categories 2 winners were POC

**There was more diversity among the winners the year #OscarsSoWhite was created than 2025.**",positivo,-15,0
"That‚Äôs an issue of systemic and historical oppression for POC participation in the filmmaking industry, not awards voting.

The overwhelming majority of films are made by white crews. How quickly do you think that can or will change? It‚Äôs clearly not an issue with Oscar voters themselves, POC are statistically ‚Äòover‚Äô represented at awards shows relative to their participation in the industry.

Most of the above awards were clearly well deserved. Ironically, it‚Äôs the awards given to the films with POC in leading roles that were the most undeserved this year (Wicked and Emilia Perez - Wicked winning an award for production design is hilarious).

The only film you could really mount an argument for being unfairly done by is Nickel Boys and the distribution and campaigning for that film has been atrocious.",negativo,10,1
